* Accel Events for main conference because it integrates better with cvent instead of Hopin or Crowdcast – Emily to clarify if Linux Foundation will provide this and run behind the scenes work   (https://www.accelevents.com/)
 

### Marketing/Communication 

* Decided no CMEthis year, maybe in the future in a smaller event as a pilot
* R consortium marketing committee will take charge – at next meeting, we will draft a plan – ideas discussed today include:
  + Email promo to RUGs, with 10% discount code (RMED22RUG) 
  + Advertise at rstudio::conf 2022 (7/25-28) – man a booth, have R/Medicine branded swag and printed sponsorship prospectus to hand out, advertise R/Medicine in a session on R consortium 
  + Blog posts and tweets – create a schedule of tweets and blog posts, could start every other week then higher cadence as we get closer to the conference. Topics could include: web site up; keynote speaker highlights; workshop highlights; visit R/Med at rstudio::conf

  CONSORT diagrams are a standard requirement for reporting clinical trials, but are currently   
  artisanal graphics. Creating a standard package and workflow from data to output of this diagram 
  would be enormously useful, and currently is a major gap in R capabilities for clinical trials.
