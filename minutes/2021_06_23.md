## Platform / Logistics

* Main track: CrowdCast. 
  + doesn't work well for hard of hearing, would like automatic captioning
  + Stephan will mention to CrowdCast afterwards that this would be a nice option.
* Short courses: Zoom (R consortium account?). Will likely need more than one room but can set that up later.
* BOFs: Spatial.chat. Create our own room? **Vanessa is happy to design a space - Daniela working on a draft.**  Have speakers with hex stickers send image to Vanessa so that people can 'chat' about it. 

### Outreach/Promotion!

* RUGS Interview - Joe to follow-up with James Anderson from R Consortium
* Weekly tweet! Stephan was having issues with Twitter access (see TweetDeck.  Mike to add Stephan)

Create meme using https://imgflip.com/i/5dj4zp (SK to add in SAS and R logos)

### Inclusion/Diversity

* Re-engage MiR, R/Ladies, R consortium diversity. Mara spoke with  
  Samantha for ideas: 
    + offer diversity scholarships, have people apply for scholarship (write a blurb).  Could also have other registrants agree to sponsor someone else. Work with Vanessa to modify website (add a link to send email if they could use a discount.  Mara will discuss with Brian and Vanessa).
    + Geographical diversity - easy to measure
    + Create slack channel around diversity
    + Does platform allow "audio only"?
    + Spatial Chat with moderator focused on diversity
    + Spatial Chat/BoF for different languages (spanish, french, chinese table)
    
### Sponsorships/Partnerships

* LF handling Novartis sponsorship. Updates?
* Biogen? **Romi to follow up**
