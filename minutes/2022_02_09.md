#### Sponsorship 

Don't want to target R consortium members since they are already paying money to be involved/helping indirectly.  Maybe a reduced rate for them if they are a sponsor?

Sponsor ideas: Novartis, Merck, AbbVie, BMS, Sanofi, Pfizer

#### Keynotes/Invited talks

AppliedEpi - Joe presented - https://appliedepi.org/tutorial/ . Lots of interest in moving towards R (R in West Africa or Haiti).  Working with "Doctors without Borders." Might be some interesting talks/keynotes. Joe will pass contact info to Peter to reach out to Neil.

Davis Vaughn (davis@rstudio.com) - willing to do 20/30 min talk on {clock}. Steve is willing to send invite email.

* 3-4 keynotes would be nice. JJ said yes, Peter talking with Neil as a potential, Steve to check with Frank Harrell. Stephan checking with Stephen Master.
