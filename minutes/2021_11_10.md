## Minutes 

* Next meeting, *December 1st* then every 2 weeks
* Discussed CME with Emily 
  - we can offer credit for workshops + conference
  - ~$1,000 application fee for CME
  - at end of conference, email participants, they go into portal and record hours, then it will go into myCME.  All presenters would need to complete a COI form. Peter would need to be the course director on record. COI needs to be completed prior to the conference. Cat herding can be added in to cost. 
  - MOC credit $25 plus $7 per question.  Do we want to offer this?  For this year, let's focus just on CME. 
  - takes about a month to get up and running.  Should build this into the timeline.

* Stephan reached out to presenter for GIS spatial course and she agreed.
* Data visualization - should reach out Klaus (#2 U of Texas) & Kieren (#1 Duke) - maybe one would be willing to teach.  Steve agreed to reach out to them to see if one of them is interested in presenting.
* Beth to reach out to Emily for survival class.

* What might we want for a conference theme (for keynotes)?  
  + Data analytics for healthcare systems. Think about possible presenters. How can we reach the patients we want to reach (continuity of care, marketing, ...).
  + Communicating data to non-tech audiences
