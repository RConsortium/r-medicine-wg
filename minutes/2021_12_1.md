* Beth to reach out to Emily for survival class (basic up to competing risk).
* Bayesian workshop? rstan? clinical trials? Practical issues (selecting priors)? focus on rare diseases?
  + target biostatisticians (but little theory) Ben Goodrich?  Identify a good dataset?  {basket} exchangeability models. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020/RJ-2021-020/index.html
  + can we identify some datasets for Bayesian class? Often used for mixed effects models, sequential trials, combine rare disease trials (see {basket})?  Can we add to Peter's data package?

### General themes/initiatives

Are there topics that R/Med can help promote?

* Create/maintain example datasets that can be used for comparisons
* Ask sponsors - can you sponsor a dataset?  Maybe subsets of clinical trials, add some random components, would help get around some of the privacy restrictions.  {ctrialsgov} helpful?
* encouraging data sharing, reproducibility

#### Ideas from previous minutes

* What might we want for a conference theme (for keynotes)?

  + https://ohdsi.org/ (pronounced "Odyssey") Data standardizing, common data models, analytic R tools
  + Paul Harris, REDCap founder - future of REDCap
    Epic/REDCap integration - adjudicate data from EPIC, CDIS REDCap

## R Journal articles

* Send email out (end of next week) and in January requesting articles
