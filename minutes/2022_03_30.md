Most of the meeting was sent on finalizing the conference website


### Emily

* R/Medicine 2022 website
  This is currently hosted @ https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/ but we might  want to change that to https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine-2022/ to have a permalink
https://r-medicine.org and https://r-medicine.com should both redirect to the new splash page

* Add Early Bird language on splash page
* Link should be white (not blue) and point to where previous year's page is hosted. We're not actually sure where this is currently hosted. One way to do this would be to look at where r-medicine.org redirects to (I think Brian set this redirect up and should know?)
* Add a "Registration" page that has details about pricing as well as diversity and need based scholarships
   * D&I language proposed (Registration Scholarship: Complimentary registration is available to enable community members to attend when they would otherwise be unable due to a lack of funding. We place an emphasis on funding applicants who are from historically underrepresented or untapped groups and/or those of lower socioeconomic status. If you work for a company that has the ability to fund your travel, we ask that you not apply, to save funds for those that need it.) Add terminology to articulate limited space available for the 
* R/Medicine 2021 website
  * Might need to ask Vanessa Paolantonio to get access there 
  * Past Events tab: link to the 2020 page currently points to https://events.linuxfoundation.org/r-medicine/. This should point to https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2020/r-medicine instead where this page is now located
  * Changes to cvent
    * Create discount codes, Emily to pull from last years registration
    * Create an Early Bird discount (20%); dates (until to 6/19) for all registrants 

### Joe -- ask Sam Toet to join next meeting to discuss D&I
