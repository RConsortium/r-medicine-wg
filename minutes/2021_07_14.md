Should we think about adding a few e-poster rooms in spatial chat? We could put 4 e-posters per room/cluster.  Perhaps do this in the evening?   https://blog.spatial.chat/online-poster-session-best-practices-spatial-chat/

* Denise noted that she will be on vacation during the conference with spotty internet.  Best not to assign her to any roles.

* Joe checked - JJ won't talk about his {quarto} package.

### Website

* Add diversity scholarship web form - Mara

## Platform / Logistics

* CrowdCast. Will sign up and start testing soon. Daniella to get this started soon. Would be good to get a 3rd person to help with behind the scenes.  Peter to look at volunteer list, Mike volunteered.
* Short courses: Zoom (R consortium account). Will likely need more than one room but can set that up later.
* BOFs: Spatial.chat. 
* Need to figure out (Brian to work on this): 
  1. how to move registrations from cvent to Crowdcast automatically (there appears to be a way to do this using https://zapier.com/apps/crowdcast/integrations); 
  2. how to send emails to participants? Easiest is for us to draft the email/audience and Brian will get it sent out. 
  
* How to handle registration for workshops? Several presenters want to have limits on the number for workshops. Ranked choice or first come/first served? Need to be able to explain it to people who don't get in. Brian will see if it possible to update extra field for registration in cvent. Close down and notify people 1 week before the conference. There are 2 R Consortium Zoom sessions that we may be able to use (limit of 500 participants/room).  If we do add the form soon, then fewer people have to go back in and modify registration.

* Peter to start organizing documents on how to moderate sessions, how to do behing the scenes Crowdcast, how to do BoF.

### Outreach/Promotion!

* RUGS Interview is up - https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2021/06/29/stephan-kadauke-from-r-medicine-talks-to-r-consortium-about-racial-bias  Could Rstudio or Hadley tweet this? Joe to check on this (Hadley still on vacation).  
* Everyone should advertise internally. $10 signups for Mayo, Penn, CHOP, UMichigan, Cornell, Rstudio, Procogia, Yale and will send info to us (Brian has set this up, Stephan to send this out this week).
