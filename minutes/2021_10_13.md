## Minutes 

* Introductions: Laura is taking over for Daniella as a representative of Procogia

* Discussion on tidymodels/parsnip - R/Pharma
  - geared towards prediction accuracy, not always objective

* Discussions for R/Med (conference, other activities)  
  - Focus on "tidy" - good & bad
  - Fairness/interpretability/cost with predictive models - other measures 
    are important beyond accuracy.
  - Can we look at OHDSI https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/ and work with them?
  
* R Journal - Mike to start pushing for articles (send note to presenters, maybe personal
invites to certain talks?).  Laura to check on sending to presenters - talk to R Consortium
(GDPR permission issues).  Can we base summary article on Joe's article?

* Bioconductor - top person retired. Should we have some Omics/R talks next year? Some packages are ending up on CRAN and not Bioconductor. Beth and Daniel to talk to contacts to see if there are some "entry level" talks that might be of interest to our conference attendees.
