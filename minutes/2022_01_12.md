## Minutes 

* Next meeting, *January 26* 

Agenda: 

* Let's start a planning doc R/Medicine 2022
  * What should happen by when? This includes Event-in-a-box activities.
  * Themes? Keynotes?
  * Marketing - can we leverage RC marketing cmt to reach RUGs? They should have many medical users. Would this be a discussion with Sam Toet?
* Jesse to interview Karandeep about botched Epic prediction models
* Process for year-round programming / 4 workshops a year? Can R Consortium support this? We will need a standard process for (event planning work, social media campaign, event infrastructure, CME?, and post-event work -- really a modification/extension of the event-in-a-box model). I think we will be able to get content to do 4 workshops throughout the year. This should drive recognition and growth of R/Medicine.

### To Do

* Stephan to reach out to Elisa Trevino (etrevino@linuxfoundation.org) to join the next meeting
* Peter to reach out to Kieren via Twitter
* Joe to bring up Kanban/github at R Foundation marketing group - who can help get us started?
   - see example - https://github.com/RConsortium/submissions-wg/projects
* Joe will see if we can get commitment from someone at Rstudio for talk/workshop {quarto}.  Keynote about upending publishing world.

* Michael will tweet "hold the date" (Aug 23-26) for 2022 conference
* Stephan to ask Cathy O'Neil (Weapons of Math Destruction, The Shame Machine) as keynote
* Stephan to ask Stephen Master (How can we ensure reproducibility and clinical translation of machine learning applications in laboratory medicine?)
* Beth to reach out to Emily for survival class (basic up to competing risk).
* Stephan to ask Michael Kearns

### Notes

* data cleaning workshop - Peter starting to develop
* Steve contacted Frank Harrell - he is considering/confirming
* Steve reached out to Kieren - waiting to hear back. 
* Quarto will be announced (Rstudio conference, July?) - maybe we can do a workshop at R/Med?  Helpful if you have multiple languages. Focus for publishing. 
  - if Joe can get JJ as keynote, he will agree to chair the conference
