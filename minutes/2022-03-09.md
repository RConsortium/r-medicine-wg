## Workshop ideas

* Stefan to reach out to Dan Sjoberg re gtsummary - table 1, modeling table, adverse events table
* data cleaning workshop - Peter starting to develop
* Steve contacted Frank Harrell - he has agreed
* Quarto will be announced (Rstudio conference, July?) - maybe we can do a workshop at R/Med?  Helpful if you have multiple languages. Focus for publishing. 
  - if Joe can get JJ as keynote, he will agree to chair the conference
* dataviz workshop - possibly Cedric Scherer? @CedScherer

## Keynotes

* AppliedEpi (Neil) - Joe presented - https://appliedepi.org/tutorial/ . Lots of interest in moving towards R (R in West Africa or Haiti). Working with "Doctors without Borders." Might be some interesting talks/keynotes. Joe will pass contact info to Peter to reach out to Neil.
* Frank Harrell - topic TBD
* Davis Vaughn (davis@rstudio.com) - willing to do 20/30 min talk on {clock}. Steve is willing to send invite email.
* JJ Allaire on Quarto
