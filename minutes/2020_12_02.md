## Minutes

Data capturing and compliancy for clinical trials - not always clear what needs to be validated.  How does R fit into this. How do we automate clinical trials - monitoring, dsmb. 

Peter - still planning to teach short course on data management but there are some issues.  Will discuss later with Daniella.

Michael will start nagging people regarding submissions to the R Journal for the special edition (currently there are 3 submissions, 2 are Michael's).
