### Review numbers

* Need some final stats on the conference (SK to write email to Brian for cvent report). Can we get some of these recorded for 2020, too?
  + number of registrants (types)
  + number of primary countries
  + number self-identified as POC
  + way to sort out MD/non-MD?
  + number who viewed Crowdcast (by time?)
  + CME?
  + numbers/workshop
  + how much money/sponsorship do we have?

### Review

* YouTube workshop recordings - JR: need editing (e.g., remove deadtime, maybe some artistic cleaning). BA: add link to slides/workshop content if available.  Can we pay for someone to edit?
  + Can we make SAS2R Procogia material available? Daniella will check
  + How do we find someone to edit?  Maybe Vanessa?  SK to ask. Start with 1) reproducible workshop, 2) SAS2R, 3) Excel
  + Intro to R - might be worth making as a product with CME credit
  
* When should talks be made public?  They are already on YouTube but not publicized. 

* Send out Conference Feedback form again

* Send out link to attendees with workshops/talks

* Can we do something with the posters?  Going to be available on SpatialChat forever.

* All talks linked on website right now!

* Need to practice more, have fewer people (recommend: 2-4 BTS, 2-4 playing video). What is the role of a moderator in the virtual setting?  When do we move to having some paid people to help?
