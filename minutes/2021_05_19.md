### Planning for August meeting (August 24-25 workshops, August 26-27 conference)

### Program

- Reviewed [Program planning sheet]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InL_bX-URU43TwFIOCNfYtgnelXsahxHT-Kog0jsh9o/edit#gid=0)
   + ask presenters to plan for 3.5 hrs for short course but block 4 hours
   + single room for spatial chat - 1 table labeled for each BoF, set up table for keynote speaker, tables for packages, tables for sponsors?  
   + require lightning talks be recorded (8 min). Add this to the web/abstract form. 
   + add designated video player, tweeter

- Keynotes: dates confirmed
- Themes - will figure out after seeing the abstracts

### Workshops

- 101: Ted Laderas is a definite maybe. Happy to tag team with additional instructors (Ted Laderas, Mara Alexeev, Daniel Chen, Shannon Hagerty). To save effort, we discussed using a refreshed version of last year’s material: https://github.com/skadauke/intro-to-r-for-clinicians-rmed2020
- Alison Hill is interested in an R Markdown for Reproducible Research (R^3) workshop. The idea is to develop a new workflow that incorporates resynthesis of data and ephemeral playground environments (i.e. {holepunch}). Stephan and Alison talking to Rich Iannone on Friday about this.  Maybe use {synthpop} package for data (share data without disclosing read data). 
- Peter Higgins, Will Beasley: Clinical Trial Data Management with Excel -> REDcap (take a look at {ReviewR package - new})
- Marynia Kolak: Spatial analysis of health data
- Procogia: ?

### Platform / Logistics

- Main track: CrowdCast
- Short courses: Zoom (R consortium account?). Will we need more than one room?
- BOFs: Spatial.chat seems like a great option. Pay for 500 concurrent people x 2 days ($900/day)? Recommend several of us attend a public demo event to better understand how it works. 

### Web site

- Linux Foundation (LF) requires code of conduct and a few other things before go-live, now planned 5/24
- Need 1-2 volunteers as personal point of contact
- Registration via cvent
- Abstracts via main web site
- Tutorial/workshop (30 minutes to 3.5 hours)
- Encourage having 1 person presenting and 1 person asking questions

### Inclusion/Diversity

- Engage MiR, R/Ladies, R consortium after website go-live
Sponsorships/Partnerships
- Waiting on LF to create process for accepting $. Then should engage Novartis and others (Peter posted a long list a while back). Each sponsor could have a virtual “table” on spatial.chat
- Procogia: Crowdcast
- AACC? MSACL?
- AMIA?
