## Minutes 

* R/Med balance after conference (incl. last year's balance, too): balance is $23,000.  
May be another $3500 from Novartis coming, too.

* Watch party - would be limited to each institution to manage. Goal to avoid lawyers. For instance,
potentially an issue with non-CHOP people attending at CHOP. Wouldn't be sponsored by R/Medicine. 

* Can we get date/basic website/sponsorship info figured out soon? 
  + August 23-26, 2022 (2 days workshop, 2 days conference). 11:00-19:00 EDT.  Use same general schedule as this year. 
  + All agreed that getting workshops identified prior to registration would help decrease confusion
  + "Intro to R" workshop - Stephan/CHOP 
  + "Intro to survival" workshop, Beth maybe with Emily Zabor? Beth to reach out to Emily.
  + More on REDCap?  Maybe Will Beasley could talk about the arch functions that he uses?
  + Maybe something with the "quarto" package? Joe will see what is happening internally at RStudio regarding the package.
  + Frank as keynote speaker again on medical reproducibility?

  + Event-in-a-box.  The $7.5k plan looks like it is the best fit for us.  Also would like some support for running the conference/platforms (Brian to discuss with events team, this will increase cost - good thing for sponsors to help support). 
  + Box of swag for watch parties - R Consortium works with company that can organize this (needs advanced planning, people enter in code on website). Pinnacle branding https://www.pinnaclebranding.com/
  + Can Michigan do CME?  Stephan to talk with Peter
  + Brian created Google drive folder that we can use to store misc documents - we'll start populating this (gathering documents from past conferences) https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1HG3CNwHnoDIogqCehkbBQ-T_Dt8zXupu 
  + Sponsorship levels: Gold $10,000; Silver $7,500; Bronze $5,000; Exhibit Fee $3,500 (Stephan has draft that he'd put together). Brian also shared example.
* Stephan shared "RMed Cognitive Walkthrough.doc" with Beth - planning items near the conference start date
  
* For one off workshops there are better mechanisms/cheaper than event-in-a-box
