### SWOT Analysis

#### Strengths

* Large international following
* Experience with successful virtual events
* Inexpensive operation because run by volunteers
* Skilled, knowledgeable team of opinion leaders in the field
* Effective channel of distribution via R Consortium and Linux Foundation

#### Weaknesses

* Volunteer model leads to burnout as well as bare-minimum, last-minute mode of operation
* Not taking full advantage of Linux Foundation capabilities and resources
* No shared knowledge base - scattered Google documents

#### Opportunities

* Become global leader for providing medical R educational content
* Establish reproducibility as de rigeur in medical publishing by promoting R Markdown/Quarto - start looking at specific journals
  + Who is an editor for what journal?
* Revenue from CME
* Revenue from sponsorships

##### Threats

* Lack of differentiation from R/Pharma
* May be difficult to find sponsors since we compete with R/Pharma 
* Profit loss from over-hiring
* Negative press

### Plans for the future

* Viewing parties (type of hybrid)
* Take advantage of Linux Foundation "conference in a box" - help with logistics (**Joe** to send out link)
* Also should have a "social media in a box" - can Linux Foundation help develop?
* "Workshop in a box"? - include how to offer CME credits
* Have year round calendar - what should be done when (**Beth** to start document in github repository)
  + also would be nice to have year-round programming
  + e.g. R Journal submissions
* Need detailed task list - who does what when
* How do we want to connect with Carpentry
