# Questions

* Workshops - Currently "day-of" workshop emails state they can email us with their preferred workshop selection and we will do our best to accommodate. Do we want to allow this or stick to the Aug. 20 deadline?

* Hopin emcees - Have these been finalized? I'd like to send them the speaker guide so they know how to interact in Hopin. (Finalized at meeting, added to Googlesheet)

* Booths - Do we want to set up an R/Medicine or R/Consortium booth? It might be nice to fluff up the expo area - see attached examples for reference. This can be very simple and have a slide with Contact R/Medicine, key websites, etc.
