  The 3rd annual R/Medicine conference was planned as a physical event to be held in Philadelphia in August 2020. However, the nationwide lockdown induced by the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a quick transition to a virtual conference. In this article we describe the challenges and benefits we encountered with this transition, plus an overview of the conference content.

## Introduction

R/Medicine is an active working group of the R consortium, with the goal of supporting R users in the medical industry. The group includes a mix of statisticians and physicians who use R regularly in their work, plus members from RStudio and the R Foundation.  In 2020 this group organized the third annual R/Medicine conference which was originally going to be held in Philadelphia. However, by early April 2020 it was clear that the conference would need to be held virtually.  In this article, we aim to describe the challenges and benefits we encountered holding a virtual conference with the hopes of providing useful information for other organizers of a small conference.  

## Conference Planning

Initial planning for the conference began in January 2020, and during the
first few months of the year we had begun identifying keynote speakers and
workshop leaders, and begun negotiations with a hotel near
the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia which was helping host the
conference. By the beginning of April we
realized that we would need to switch to a virtual conference. The initial
challenge for the planning committee was identifying
technology that would allow us to run a main session of presentations,
have short courses, and have some sort of Birds of a Feather (BoF)
activity. Because this is a small conference with a limited budget we had
limited choices for the online conferencing platform.  With help from the
Linux Foundation who provided reviews of some of the available conference
platforms, we chose to use Crowdcast (https://www.crowdcast.io). 
This tool was simple to
use for the attendees and the organizers, had a green room to line up
speakers, an interactive chat feature, and the ability to automatically
replay a talk once it was over. The short courses were conducted using
Zoom and rmed2020.cloud for interactive programming in a pre-defined environment.  Zoom was also
used for the BoF sessions.  Finally, we used Slack for communication
between the organizers, the participants and the presenters.  Certain
channels were created for participants and other channels were limited to
the conference planners.  

At the end of the conference, all the presentations were loaded onto the
R/Medicine 2020 YouTube playlist hosted by the R Consortium. Since
September 13, 2020 when the videos were loaded, there have been over 3,185
views. 

Registration and abstract submission was facilitated by infrastructure
provided by the Linux Foundation.  GoogleSheets were used to centralize
organization of the program and the list of volunteers. Finally, Twitter was used to create excitement about the conference and to inform potential attendees of workshops and keynote speakers. 

### Volunteers 

Volunteers needed for the virtual conference were significantly higher than for the previous in-person conferences.  For each short course we had at least one teaching assistant for every 10 participants.  Additionally, we had someone monitoring the Zoom chat to escalate issues when appropriate. 
For the main session we had two moderators who alternated between speakers so that they could orient the upcoming speaker in the green room.  We also had a Crowdcast host who helped behind the scenes and moved participants from one presentation to the next. One person was also in charge of playing any of the talks that were pre-recorded.  Finally, each BoF room had a facilitator. Because this was virtual, we had back-up volunteers identified in case there were power outages in a particular region of the country.  Pre-conference technical checks were held prior to the conference for the speakers, instructors, and volunteers. 

## The Conference

In the previous two years, attendance at the conferences were less than 150.  In 2020, 587 people registered for the conference including 225 students, 185 academics, 104 from industry, and 73 who were working on COVID related projects.  Of these, 32% were from outside the United States coming from 43 countries.  Out of those who registered, 452 attended at least some of the sessions live and 431 watched some of the sessions via the replay feature in Crowdcast.

Pre-conference events included two short courses presented on the day prior to the conference.  The first course, *Introduction to R for Clinicians*, was taught by other clinicians.  The second course *Introduction to Machine Learning with Tidymodels* was taught by Alison Hill and focused more on the data scientist/statistician audience.   

The main conference was held over two days and included 4 keynote addresses, 16 regular talks, 11 lightning talks, and 1 panel discussion.
The schedule included three BoF time slots, each with 4-5 different topics.

Attendance at the short courses were limited by request of the instructors.
143 participants attended the class geared towards clinicians and 80
attended the Tidymodels course.  Because there were more people interested
than slots, we randomly selected from all who were interested.  The courses
were recorded and anyone who registered for the conference could later view
either one.


### Scientific Program

The general themes for the presentations were:

* R in Clinical Research/Clinical Trials
* Collaboration/reproducibility
* New analysis approaches and packages
* Education and bioethics
* Dashboards and Shiny Apps
* COVID research

We received 43 abstracts and accepted 25.  Additionally, we held space for late-breaking COVID related presentations and for two sponsors.  

## Lessons learned

Overall, the conference succeeded well beyond our expectations.  Some of the lessons we learned are as follows.

* The chat feature helped build community and allowed active participation in the conference. For instance, some presenters tag-teamed where one person presented and another answered questions via chat as questions arose.  Other presentors pre-recorded their talk and answered questions about their presentations.  

* The use of Slack was essential for the behind the scenes coordination, especially as issues arose.  Additionally, we had participants create their own channels and zoom sessions to further discussion on certain issues.

* Having back-ups for all the major coordinating roles was important.  Fortunately we had limited issues, but 

* It takes more time to transition between presenters and this needs to be built into the schedule, especially if there are technical issues.   

* During the presentations it was challenging to let speakers know when they were running out of time. All moderators downloaded a doorbell app to their phones that they played at pre-specified times, however that was not always sufficient.  For 2021 we are planning to only allow pre-recorded lightning talks to help with this issue. 

* Having a virtual meeting greatly expanded our reach. In 2019 we held the conference in Boston and had roughly 100 attendees from a handful of countries whereas in 2020 we had 587 from 43 countries. The larger attendance will increase our ability to obtain sponsors for future conference.  

* Recruitment for high caliber keynote speakers was perhaps easier since the time commitment was significantly less. 

## Sponsors

We would like to thank all the sponsors that supported the 2020 conference: American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC), Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), Association for Mass Spectrometry & Advances in the Clinical Lab (MSACL), Procogia, the R Consortium, RStudio, and Yale School of Public Health.  

## Acknowledgements

As members of the R/Medicine 2020 Organizing Committee, we would like to thank all the volunteers that contributed to the success of the conference, the Program Committee members, keynote and contributed speakers, and all the attendees who came and participated.

### About this format and the R Journal requirements

`rticles::rjournal_article` will help you build the correct files requirements: 

* A R file will be generated automatically using `knitr::purl` - see
https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/purl.html for more information.
* A tex file will be generated from this Rmd file and correctly included in
`RJwapper.tex` as expected to build `RJwrapper.pdf`.
* All figure files will be kept in the default rmarkdown `*_files` folder. This
happens because `keep_tex = TRUE` by default in `rticles::rjournal_article`
* Only the bib filename is to modifed. An example bib file is included in the
template (`RJreferences.bib`) and you will have to name your bib file as the
tex, R, and pdf files.
