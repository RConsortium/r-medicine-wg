Dear Dr. XXXXX,

We are writing to invite you to be a keynote speaker at the virtual 2022 R/Medicine conference on August 25th-26th, 2022. The R/Medicine conference and community is a volunteer-based effort promote the development and use of R based tools to improve clinical research and practice. 

R/Medicine is now in its fifth year, and last year we were able to attract more than 600 participants from 60 different countries. This year, R/Medicine will again be fully virtual. We think your work on socially aware algorithms would be of outstanding interest to our attendees.

We are hoping that you could talk about topics which could include [algorithmic bias, how public health issues can arise when clinically used algorithms are biased, and how this problem could be addressed].

We are planning to go live with the conference website in March, and it would be very helpful if we could confirm the keynote slots beforehand. It would be great to have you participate.

Thanks for your consideration,

The R/Medicine 2022 Organizing Committee
