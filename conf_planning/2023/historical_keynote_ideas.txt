Ideas for keynote speakers:

* Visualization? J. Murdoch
* Covid related? 
  + Ryan Tibshirani - Delphi group/CMU, Caroline Buckee - Harvard,  Nicholas Reich https://reichlab.io/research
  + Covid Qualitative Research - Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith Yale
* FDA?
* Any international speakers?
  + Thomas Jaki "Designing Clinical Trials during a Pandemic" (UK)
* Amgen & Clinical Trials
* John Chambers - not interested
* Send invite to Karandeep Singh, Caroline Buckhee
* Karandeep Singh agreed
* Still waiting to hear from Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith
* Other Alison Hill - COVID Data Forum - maybe?  Want to leverage what we learned about COVID for the next hot topic.  Not just "here is where we are with COVID".
* Does anyone know Nicholas Reich?  
* Does anyone know Nicholas Reich? Peter will invite. 
* Still waiting to hear from Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith - still no response
  + Frank as keynote speaker again on medical reproducibility?
    https://www.fharrell.com/post/errmed/

    https://pandemicpuzzle.stanford.edu/
* Public Health/Epidemiology, hotspots - Delphi group 

* What might we want for a conference theme (for keynotes)?  
  + Data analytics for healthcare systems. Think about possible presenters. How can we reach the patients we want to reach (continuity of care, marketing, ...).
  + Communicating data to non-tech audiences
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Cox
     * https://hannahfry.co.uk/new-yorker-article-when-graphs-are-a-matter-of-life-and-death-june-2021/

    Epic/REDCap integration - adjudicate data from EPIC, CDIS REDCap

* Steve to ask Frank Harrell
* Stephan to ask Cathy O'Neil (Weapons of Math Destruction, The Shame Machine)
* Peter sent email to previous keynotes asking for nominations
* Communicating data to non-tech audiences
