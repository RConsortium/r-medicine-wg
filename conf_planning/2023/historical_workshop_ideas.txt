Workshop ideas

* REDCap/data management
* Data Viz? 
* How to Excel
* How to REDCap to R
* Modeling with Medical Text Data, tidytext
* Tables with GT
* Shiny for Clinical Trials
* RMarkdown for reproducible reports
* Shiny Model Output
* Predictive modeling with text using tidy data principles
  Emil Hvitfeldt (University Southern California)
* Leaving the Cult of SAS
* Analyzing clinical trial data (ADaM)
* mixed models and repeated measures in longitudinal clinical research
* Building real-time dashboards
* Data visualization
* Alison Hill agreed to do another presentation
  + what can Alison teach?  Stephan will reach out and discuss with her - what might she want to talk?
  + Rmarkdown for your manuscript - figures, tables, references (Citr), output to word, tiff, pdf, and multi panel with patchwork
  + Possibly dataviz in R with Kieran Healy and/or Claus Wilke
  + Ted Laderas for Intro to R for Medical Data
  + Something with Frank Harrell?

Could R consortium do something with REDCap?  Could it host REDCap for smaller entities?

Might be willing to help further connections of R and 
* Will Beasley (REDCapR) at Oklahoma email <whb4@ou.edu> 
* macleankaca@gmail.com - Kenneth MacLean - made the collaboratoR package

* Do we want to do a workshop on Excel and R (Peter)?
* Can we figure out how to do a REDCap workshop?  Several people at Mayo have questions and would like to engage with REDCap R package developers on potential updates.  Can we help with that?

  + "Intro to R" workshop - Stephan/CHOP 
  + "Intro to survival" workshop, Beth maybe with Emily Zabor? Beth to reach out to Emily.
  + More on REDCap?  Maybe Will Beasley could talk about the arch functions that he uses?
  + Maybe something with the "quarto" package? Joe will see what is happening internally at RStudio
* Stephan reached out to presenter for GIS spatial course and she agreed.
* Data visualization - should reach out Klaus (#2 U of Texas, wilke@austin.utexas.edu) & Kieren (#1 Duke, kieran.healy@duke.edu) - maybe one would be willing to teach.  Steve agreed to reach out to them to see if one of them is interested in presenting.
* Beth to reach out to Emily for survival class (basic up to competing risk).
* Bayesian workshop? rstan? clinical trials? Practical issues (selecting priors)? focus on rare diseases?
  + target biostatisticians (but little theory) Ben Goodrich?  Identify a good dataset?  {basket} exchangeability models. https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2020/RJ-2021-020/index.html
  + can we identify some datasets for Bayesian class? Often used for mixed effects models, sequential trials, combine rare disease trials (see {basket})?  Can we add to Peter's data package?

* Power/Sample-size calculations (take a look at recent RStudio webinar, Joe)?
