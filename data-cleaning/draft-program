Planning for Data Cleaning Workshop

Example workshop website we can follow:
https://github.com/shannonpileggi/gtreg-workshop-rinpharma-2022

This would total 3 (or 4) hours, with 10-minute breaks each hour,
and I was wondering if you would be interested in demonstrating some of the benefits
of tidyxl and unpivotr for particularly messy medical data
(I can build the messy medical data sets to suit).


Duncan, If you can, take a look at (scroll down to the bottom) https://github.com/higgi13425/medicaldata
the 5 messy datasets here to see if they would help demonstrate the benefits of tidyxl and unpivotr.


Draft outline


Principles of Data Management (CL)
Structuring from the beginning for success
Generating and using a codebook/data dictionary
introduction to validating your data (ranges, categories)
Finding the problems - what is untidyness? missingness? out of range? invalid values? (CL)
Exploratory Data Tools (CL) - Data checking - Exploratory Data Validation
skimr
visdat, naniar
DataExplorer
Data validation tools (pointblank)
Stage 1 cleaning (SMP)
skipping headers at top of sheet
janitor for empty rows/columns
Cleaning names - janitor::clean_names, labelling varnames, labelling values
adding units to variable names/labels to help future you
bad categories: Hispanic and hispanic and hispannic in one column
bad values: NAs, -999 or 99 in a numeric column
mixed lab data - potassium mostly numeric, except for occasional: "test invalid due to hemolysis", or platelets mostly numeric, with some "115 (may be inaccuately low due to clumping)".
parsing numbers mixed with text
when to use unite/separate
cleaning up dates - lubridate, clock, janitor:: excel_numeric_to_date


Stage 2 cleaning/wrangling (PH)
Concept of unit of observation - is the unit of observation a visit/hospital stay (taller dataset)? or a patient (wider)?
tidyr: Pivoting wider, longer
padr to fill in dates/times
Joins of data from different sources - patient demographics (local) with social vulnerability index from CDC


Stage 3 - Advanced data cleaning tools for complicated messiness (DG)
tidyxl
unpivotr
*unheadr?
Also, consider Karl Broman's principles:
